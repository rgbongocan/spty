# spty
A simple spotify CLI using click and spotipy

This was made for personal use and as an exercise in making CLIs. However it should work fairly well, behaving similar to macOS shpotify.

This does not communicate with your Spotify app directly but rather with API calls. It's a remote controller. As such, users need to have a Spotify premium account and create a Spotify app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/. See https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/ for more instructions.
